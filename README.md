# RNAseq Analysis 

The file RNAseq Analysis DEGs to Pathways.Rmd  has  R chunk to find out Differntially Expressed Genes (DEGs) from RNAseq counts and use those DEGs for Gene Ontolgy, Pathway Analysis and Upstream Regulators (still need more work done!).

The file edgeR_DESeq2_voom.rmd has R chunk for to find out Differentially Expressed Genes using three common statistic tools edgeR, DESeq2 and limma-voom. The output shows comparision of DEGs from these three tool. VennDiagram show that there is considerable overlap between DEGs found by three methods.
